"Where's Papa going with the ax?" said Fern to her mother asthey were setting the table for breakfast.

"爸爸带着斧头去哪儿？"正准备早餐的阿芬问妈妈。

"Out to the hoghouse," replied Mrs. Arable. "Some pigs were born last night."

"I don't see why he needs an ax," continued Fern, who was only eight.

“去猪圈了。”阿拉巴太太回答，“昨天刚出生了几头小猪。”

“我不明白他为什么要带斧头？”只有八岁的阿芬继续问道。

"Well," said her mother, "one of the pigs is a runt. It's verysmall and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your fatherhas decided to do away with it."

“好吧，”她妈妈说，“其中一只小猪弱不禁风，它没有任何价值。所以你爸爸决定除掉它。”

"Do away with it?"

“除掉它？”

shrieked Fern. "You mean kill it? Justbecause it's smaller than the others?"

阿芬叫道：“你的意思是要杀了它？就因为它比别的猪小？”

Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table. "Don't yell,Fern!" she said. "Your father is right. The pig would probably dieanyway."

阿拉巴太太将一罐奶油放在桌上。“别嚷嚷，阿芬！”她继续说，“你爸是对的，那只猪根本活不下来。”

Fern pushed a chair out of the way and ran outdoors. The grasswas wet and the earth smelled of springtime. Fern's sneakers were sopping by the time she caught up with her father.

阿芬一把推开椅子，向外面跑去。湿漉漉的草地，仿佛春天的气息。当她追上他的父亲时，运动鞋湿透了。

"Please don't kill it!" she sobbed. "It's unfair."

“请别杀它！”她哭诉道，“这不公平。”

Mr. Arable stopped walking.

阿拉巴先生，停下脚步。

"Fern," he said gently, "you will have to learn to controlyourself."

他温柔地对女儿说：“阿芬，你该学会控制自己。”

"Control myself?" yelled Fern. "This is a matter of life anddeath, and you talk about controlling myself."

“控制自己？”阿芬叫嚷：“这可是性命攸关的事情，你却跟我说控制自己？”

Tears ran down hercheeks and she took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of herfather's hand.

泪水滑落脸庞，她过去试图从他的父亲手中夺下斧头。

"Fern," said Mr. Arable, "I know more about raising a litter ofpigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along!"

“阿芬，”阿拉巴先生说，“关于养猪的事情，我知道的比你多。它只会带来麻烦。马上离开这儿。”

"But it's unfair," cried Fern. "The pig couldn't help being born small, could it? If I had been very small at birth, would you have killed me?"

“但这不公平！”阿芬哭泣道，“猪不能决定出生的大小，不是吗？如果我出生时也弱不禁风，你是不是也要杀了我？”

Mr. Arable smiled. "Certainly not," he said, looking down at hisdaughter with love. "But this is different. A little girl is onething, a little runty pig is another."

阿拉巴先生露出一丝微笑，“当然不会，”他充满爱意地低头看着自己的女儿，"但那是不同的，猪是猪，人是人。”

"I see no difference," replied Fern, still hanging on to theax. "This is the most terrible case of injustice I ever heard of."

“我看没有什么区别！”阿芬坚持那么认为。 “这是我听过有史以来最可怕的事情！”

A queer look came over John Arable's face. He seemed almostready to cry himself.

约翰·阿拉巴尔先生一副哭笑不得的样子。

"All right," he said." You go back to the house and I will bringthe runt when I come in. I'll let you start it on a bottle, like ababy. Then you'll see what trouble a pig can be."

“好吧，也许你是对的。”他说，“你现在回家，我会把这小东西带来，由你来照顾，就像照顾婴儿那样。你会发现它有多麻烦。”

When Mr. Arable returned to the house half an hour later,hecarried a carton under his arm.

半小时后，阿拉巴先生回到家，胳膊下夹着一个纸盒。

Fern was upstairs changing hersneakers. The kitchen table was set for breakfast, and the roomsmelled of coffee, bacon, damp plaster, and wood smoke from thestove.

阿芬在楼上换鞋。厨房的餐桌上摆放着早餐。满屋子混合着咖啡，培根，潮湿的墙壁以及炉子里木烟的香味。

"Put it on her chair!" said Mrs.Arable.

“把它放在椅子上。”阿拉巴太太说。

Mr. Arable set the carton down at Fern's place. Then he walked to the sink and washedhis hands and dried them on the roller towel.

阿拉巴先生把盒子放在阿芬座位旁，转身走到水槽边洗手，用毛巾擦干。

Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying.

阿芬慢慢走下楼，她的眼睛都哭红了。

As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was ascratching noise.

她走近座位，盒子正在摇晃，发出与纸盒刮擦的声音。

Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted thelid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newbornpig. It was a white one. The morning light shone through its ears,turning them pink.

阿芬看着自己的父亲，她打开盖子，里面有一只刚出生的小猪，正盯着她看。一只白色的小猪，晨光透过它的耳朵，变成粉红色。

"He's yours," said Mr. Arable. "Saved from an untimely death.And may the good Lord forgive me for this foolish ness."

“他是你的了。”阿拉巴先生说，“是你将它从死亡边缘拉回来的。也许主会原谅我差点犯下的一个愚蠢错误。”

Fern couldn't take her eyes off the tiny pig. "Oh," shewhispered. "Oh, look at him! He's absolutely perfect."She closed the carton carefully.

阿芬的眼睛再也不能从小猪身上移开。“oh，”她低声说，“快看他，完美至极！”她小心翼翼盖上盒子。

First she kissed her father,then she kissed her mother. Then she opened the lid again, liftedthe pig out, and held it against her cheek.

她吻了自己的父亲和母亲。简直不敢相信，于是她再次打开盖子，将猪抱起，把它紧贴自己脸。

At this moment her brother Avery came into the room. Avery was ten. He was heavilyarmed--an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the other.

这时，阿芬那位只有十岁的哥哥阿福，走进屋子。他全副武装，一手拿玩具枪，另一只手拿着木头刀。

"What's that?" he demanded. "What's Fern got?"

“那是什么？”他问道，“阿芬得到了什么宝贝？”

"She's got a guest for breakfast," said Mrs. Arable."Wash yourhands and face, Avery!"

“阿芬的客人正准备享用早餐。”阿拉巴太太说，“快去洗漱，阿福！”

"Let's see it!" said Avery, setting his gun down. "You call thatmiserable thing a pig? That's a fine specimen of a pig--it's nobigger than a white rat."

“让我看看！”阿福把枪放下说，“你把这个可怜的小东西叫猪？它简直像从样本册里跑出来的，它比一只白鼠还要大。”

"Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery!" said his mother. "The school bus will be along in half an hour."

“闭嘴吧你，快点去洗漱，吃饭！”他的妈妈说，“半小时后，校车就要到了。”

"Can I have a pig, too, Pop?" asked Avery.

“我也可以养一只猪，对吗？”阿福问他的爸爸。

"No, I only distribute pigs to early risers," said Mr.Arable. "Fern was up at daylight, trying to rid world of injustice.As a result, she now has a pig. A small one, to be sure, butnevertheless a pig. It just shows what can happen if a person getsout of bed promptly. Let's eat!"

“不行，我只给早起的人。”阿拉巴先生说，“为了维护世界和平，阿芬老早就起了。因此她得到了一只猪，虽然是一只猪，但也证明了早起的好处。先吃饭！”

But Fern couldn't eat until her pig had had a drink of milk.

阿芬决定在猪喝完一杯牛奶之前，绝不吃早饭。

Mrs. Arable found a baby's nursing bottle and a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, fitted the nipple over the top,and handed it to Fern. "Give him his breakfast!" she said.

阿拉巴太太找来一个婴儿奶瓶和一个奶嘴。她将热牛奶倒进瓶子，装上奶嘴，递给阿芬，说：“给他吃早饭吧！”

A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the corner ofthe kitchen with her infant between her knees, teaching it to suckfrom the bottle. The pig, although tiny, had a good appetite andcaught on quickly.

一分钟后。阿芬坐在厨房角落的地板上，将小家伙抱在腿上，开始教他喝奶。小猪虽然很小，但胃口很大，很快掌握了喝奶的技巧。

The school bus honked from the road.

外面传来校车的喇叭声。

"Run!" commanded Mrs. Arable, taking the pig from Fern and slipping a doughnut into her hand. Avery grabbed his gun and an other doughnut.

“跑！”阿拉巴太太命令道。她从阿芬手里接过小猪，塞给她一个甜甜圈。阿福一手抓起枪，另一手拿起甜甜圈。

The children ran out to the road and climbed into the bus. Ferntook no notice of the others in the bus. She just sat and stared outof the window, thinking what a blissful world it was and how luckyshe was to have entire charge of a pig.

孩子们跑到路边，爬上校车。阿芬完全没有注意车上是否还有其他人，她呆呆的坐着，盯着窗外。她想，这是一个多么幸福的世界，她竟然幸运的拥有了一只无与伦比的猪！

By the time the bus reached school, Fern had named her pet, selecting the most beautiful nameshe could think of.

在校车启动的那一刻，阿芬决定给她的猪起一个名字，那必须是她能想得到的最美的名字！

"Its name is Wilbur," she whispered to herself.

“它的名字就叫魏二波！”她低声对自己说。

She was still thinking about the pig when the teacher said:"Fern, what is the capital of Pennsylvania?"

当她的老师提问的时候，阿芬还在想她的猪：

“阿芬，请你回答，宾夕法尼亚州的首府叫什么？”

"Wilbur," replied Fern, dreamily. The pupils giggled. Fern blushed.

“魏二波！”阿芬出神地回答。同学们咯咯咯地笑起来。阿芬的脸红了。
