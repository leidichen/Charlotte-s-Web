# 03  Escape \| 逃跑

The barn was very large. It was very old. It smelled of hay and it smelled of manure. It smelled of the perspiration of tired horses and the wonderful sweet breath of patient cows. It often had a sort of peaceful smell -- as though noghing bad could happen ever again in the world. 

谷仓虽显陈旧，倒也宽敞。干草和牛粪的味道，混杂着马的汗味及母牛身上甜蜜的芳香。空气透着平和，好像世界从此没有了烦恼。

It smelled of grain and of harness dressing and of axle grease and of rubber boots and of new rope. And whenever the cat was given a fish-head to eat, the barn would smell of fish. But mostly it smelled of hay, for there was always hay in the great loft up overhead. And there was always hay being pitched down to the cows and the hourses and the sheep.

谷粒，马具，轮滑油，橡胶靴，绳子的气味混合交杂在一起，偶尔还会闻到鱼腥味儿，假如给猫一个鱼头的话。干草的味道最重，整个谷仓全是这种东西，因为下面住着母牛、马和羊。

The barn was pleasantly warm in winter when the animals spent most of their time indoors, and it was pleasantly cool in summer when the big doors stood wide open to the breeze. 

冬天，大部分动物都待在温暖的仓内；夏天，打开仓门，凉风徐徐而入，凉爽宜人。

The barn had stalls on the main floor for the work hourses, tie-ups on the main floor for the cows, a sheepfold down below for the sheep, a pigpen down below for Wilbur, and it was full of all sorts of things that you find in barns: ladders, grindsones, pitch forks, monkey wrenches, scythes, lawn mowers, snow shovels, ax handles, milk pails, water buchers, empty grain sacks, and rusty rat traps. 

谷仓分为上下两层，上面是马厩和牛棚，下面是羊圈和猪圈，魏二波就住在下面，就连燕子也喜欢来这儿筑巢。谷仓里堆满了各种杂物，你想要什么？梯子，砂轮，干草叉，活动扳手，镰刀，割草机，雪铲，斧头，牛奶桶，水桶，空麻袋，生锈的老鼠夹……

It was the kind of barn that swallows like to build their nests in. 

这是燕子们喜欢来这儿筑巢的谷仓。

It was the kind of barn that children like to play in.

这是孩子们喜欢来这儿玩耍的谷仓。

And the whole thing was owned by Fern's uncle, Mr. Homer L. Zuckerman.

这里所有的一切都属于阿芬的舅舅——霍闷·朱克慢先生！

Wilbur's new home was in the lower part of the barn, directly underneath the cows. Mr. Zuckerman knew that a manure pile is a good place to keep a young pig. Pigs need warmth, and it was warm and comfortable down there in the barn cellar on the south side.

魏二波的新家位于谷仓下层，坐落于牛棚下面。朱克慢先生知道牛粪堆是养小猪的好地方。小猪需要温暖的环境，因此谷物仓朝南的地窖再合适不过。

Fern came almost every day to visit him. She found an old milking stool that had been discarded, and she placed the stool in the sheepfold next to Wilbur's pen. Here she sat quietly during the long afternoos, thinking and listening and watching Wilbur. 

阿芬几乎每天都来看魏二波，她从旁边找来一条没人要的挤奶凳，她把凳子放进二波的隔壁邻居的羊圈中。漫长的下午，她就这么静静的坐着，看着魏二波发呆。

The sheep soon got to know her and trust her. So did the geese, who lived with the sheep. All the animals trusted her, she was so quiet and friendly. 

羊很快就接受并信任她，和羊一起住的鹅也这么认为。所有的动物都信任她，因为阿芬真的非常安静，和善。

Mr. Zuckerman did not allow her to take Wilbur out, and he did not allow to git into the pigpen. But he told Fern that she could sit on the stool and watch Wilbur as long as she wanted to. It made her happy just to be near the pig, and it made her happy just to be near the pig, and it made Wilbur happy to know that she was sitting there, right outside his pen. But he never had any fun--no walks, no rides, no swims.

朱克慢舅舅不让阿芬带二波出去，也不允许她进入猪圈。不过他告诉阿芬，可以坐在外面的凳子上，看多久都行。阿芬只要能靠近他，哪怕远远的，也感到幸福。二波也是，知道阿芬就在外面，心里别提多高兴。但是他们再也不能一起去散步，坐推车，学游泳。

One afternoon in June, when Wilbur was almost two months old, he wandered out into his smalll yard outside the barn. Fern had not arrived for her usual visit. Wilbur stood in the sun feeling lonely and bored.

六月的一个下午。魏二波快两个月大了，他走进谷仓外面的小院子里，阿芬没有像往常那样过来看他。站在阳光下的魏二波，感到孤独和迷茫。

"There's never anything to do around here," he thought. He walked slowly to his food trough and sniffed to see if anything had been overlooked at lunch. He found a small strip of potato skin and ate it. His back itched, so he leaned against the fence and rubbed against the boards. When he tired of this, he walked indoors, climbed to the top of the manured pile , and sat down. He didn't feel like going to sleep, he didn't feel like digging, he was tired of standing still, tired of lying down. "I'm less than two months old and I'm tired of living," he said. He walked out to the yard again.

“在这儿没有任何事情可做。”他想。他慢慢地走到食槽前，努力搜寻吃剩下的午餐中还剩下些什么。他找到了一小片土豆皮，聊胜于无吧。他后背发痒，于是靠着栅栏，来回磨蹭，蹭累了，就回圈。爬上粪堆，又坐立不安，既不想睡觉，也不想挖洞，


"When I'm out here," he said, "there's no place to go but in. When I'm indoors, there's no place to go but out in the yard."

“不是去外面，就是回里面，除此之外没有别地儿可去。”他自言自语。

"That's where you're wrong, my friend, my freiend," said a voice.

“你错了，我的朋友……我的朋友。”有一个声音。

Wilbur looked through the fence and saw the goose standing there.

魏二波透过栅栏看到一只母鹅正站在那儿。

"You don't have to stay in that dirty-llittle dirty-little dirty-little yard," said the goose, who talded rather fast. 

“你不必待在那个又脏又小……又脏又小……又脏又小……的小院子里。”那只鹅说话结结巴巴，语速却很快。

"One of the boards is loose. Push on it, push-push-push on it, and come on out!"

“其中一块木板是松的，推……推……推开它，然后跑出去！”

"What?" said Wilbur. "Say it slower!"

“什么鬼？你说话能慢点吗？”魏二波说。

"At-at-at, at the risk of repeating myself," said the goose, "I suggest that you come on out. It's wonderful out here."

“在……在……在这儿你只能过重复的日子。”母鹅说，“这里虽然很精彩，但我还是建议你出去，离开这儿！”

"Did you say a board was loose?"

“你是说，这里有一块板子松了，对吗？”

"That I did, that I did," said the goose.

“瞧这儿，瞧这儿。”母鹅说。

Wilbur walked up to the fence and saw that the goose was right--one board was loose. 

魏二波走到栅栏边，那只母鹅说的没错，果然有一块板子松了。

He put his head sown, shut his eyes, and pushed. The board gave way. In a minute he had squeezed through the fence and was standing in the long grass outside his yard. The goose chuckled.

他低下头，闭上眼，推了推，木板居然开了。不一会儿功夫，他就挤出栅栏，站在院外的草丛中。母鹅笑了。

"How does it feel to be free?" she asked.

“自由的感觉如何？”

"I like it ," said Wilbur. "That is, I guess Ilike it." Actually, Wilbur felt queer to be out side his fence, with nothing between him and the big world.

“我喜欢，”魏二波说，“我想我喜欢这种感觉。”

事实上，当然魏二波站在栅栏外，从此与这个世界毫无阻隔的时候，感到有些懵圈。

"Where do you think I'd better go?"

“你认为我应该去哪？”

"Anywhere you like, anywhere you like," said the goose. "Go down through the orchard, root up the sod! Go down through the garden, dig up the radishes! Root up everything! Eat grass! Look for corn! Look for oats! Run all over! Skip and dance, jump and prance! Go down through the orchard and stroll in the woods! The world is a wonderful place when you're young.

“你喜欢的任何地方……你喜欢的任何地方！”母鹅说，“穿过果园，拱开草皮！接着穿过菜园，把萝卜拱出来！拱你想拱的一切！吃草，找玉米！找燕麦！满地打滚！唱歌跳舞走正步！穿过果园之后，漫步森林！世界多么美好啊！”

"I can see that," replied Wilbur. He gave a jump in the air, twirled, ran a few steps, stopped, looked all around, sniffed the smells of afternoon, and then set off walking down through the orchard. Pausing in the shade of an apple tree, he put his strong snout into the ground and began pushing, digging, and rooting. He felt very happy. He had plowed up quite a piece of ground before anyone noticed him.

“我知道了！”魏二波回答。他兴奋地跳起来，转圈，小跑冲刺，然后停下。环顾四周，闻闻夏日午后的自由气息，然后再穿过果园，停在苹果树的树荫下。他把强壮的鼻子伸向地面，开始推，挖，掘。他高兴极了！在别人发现他之前，他已经翻了相当大的一块地。

Mrs. Zuckerman was the first to see him. She saw him from the kitchen window, and she immediately shouted for the men.

朱克慢太太第一个发现了他。她从厨房的窗户看到他，立即大声呼喊叫人。

"Ho-mer!" she cried. "Pig's out! Lurvy! Pig's out! Homer! Lurvy! Pig's out. He's down there under that apple tree."

“霍-闷！猪跑了！”她喊道,“卢伟！猪跑出去了!霍闷，卢伟！猪越狱啦！他就在那颗苹果下！”

"Now the trouble starts," thought Wilbur." Now I'll catch it."

“啊哦，麻烦来了，”魏二波想，“他们要来抓我了。”

The goose heard the racket and she, too, started hollering. "Run-run-run downhill, make for the woods, the woods!" 

那只母鹅也听到吵闹声，大叫：“跑……跑……跑！下坡！往林子……往林子里！”

she shouted to Wilbur. "They'll never-never-never catch you in the woods."

她向魏二波喊道：“他们永远……永远……永远……别想在林子里抓到一只猪！”

The cocker spaniel heard the commotion and he ran out from the barn to join the chase. Mr. Zuckerman heard, and he came out of the machine shed where he was mending a tool. Lurvy, the hired man, heard the noise and came up from the asparagus patch where he was pulling weeds. Everybody walked toward Wilbur and Wilbur didn't know what to do. The woods seemed a long way off, and anyway, he had never been down there in the woods and wasn't sure he would like it.

可卡犬听见骚动，从谷仓里跑出来加入追逐；朱克慢先生听见了，从正在维修农具的机棚中走出来；在芦笋地拔草的长工卢伟，闻声而动。所有人悄然逼近，魏二波不知道该怎么办！树林看起来很远，不管怎么说，他从来没有到过那片林子，也不确定自己会不会喜欢那儿。

"Get around behind him, Lurvy," said Mr. Zuckerman, "and drive him toward the barn! And take it easy-don't rush him! I'll go and get a bucket of slops."

“阿伟，从后面包抄！”朱克慢先生说道，“朝谷仓赶！慢慢来，别着急！我去拿一桶猪食。”

The news of Wilbur's escape spread rapidly among the animals on the place. Whenever any creature broke loose on Zuckerman's farm, the event was of great interest to the others. 

魏二波越狱的消息很快在农场的动物中传开了。每当有动物从朱克慢家的农场逃跑时，大家都格外激动。
 
The goose shouted to the nearest cow that Wilbur was free, and soon all the cows knew. Then one of the cows told one of the sheep, and soon all the sheep knew. The lambs learned about it from their mothers. The horses, in their stalls in the barn, pricked up their ears when they heard the goose hollering; and soon the horses had caught on to what was happening. "Wilbur's out," they said. 

母鹅告诉离她最近的母牛，魏二波自由了。很快，所有的母牛都知道了这个消息。其中一头牛又对一只羊说，于是羊们都知道了。小羊从母亲那儿得到消息。马厩里的马，听到母鹅叫嚷，纷纷竖起耳朵，很快他们也知道发生了什么事情。“二波，出去了。”他们说。
 
Every animal stirred and lifted its head and became excited to know that one of his friends had got free and was no longer penned up or tied fast.

所有动物都兴奋地抬起头，显得格外激动，因为他们知道自己的朋友获得了自由，再也不用关在笼子里。

Wilbur didn't know what to do or which way to run. It seemed as through everybody was after him." If this is what it's like to be free," he thought," I believe I'd rather be penned up in my own yard."

魏二波眼下不知道该怎么办，也不清楚该往哪里跑。似乎所有人都在追他。“如果这就是自由的感觉，”他想，“我倒宁愿被关在院子里。”

The cocker spaniel was sneaking up on him from one side. Lurvy the hired man was sneaking up on him from the other side. Mrs. Zuckerman stood ready to head him off if he started for the garden, and now Mr. Zuckerman was coming down toward him carrying a pail.

可卡犬从一边悄悄靠近；卢伟从另一边慢慢靠拢；朱克慢太太则站在通往花园的必经之地预备拦截。此时，朱克慢先生提着一桶猪食，正朝他走来。

" This is really awful," thought Wilbur. "Why doesn't Fern come?" He began to cry.

“糟透了，”魏二波想，“为什么阿芬不来？”他难过的哭起来。

The goose took command and began to give orders.

母鹅接过指挥棒开始发号施令。

"Don't just stand there, Wilbur! Dodge about, dodge about!" cried the goose." Skip around, run toward me, slip in and out, in and out, in and out! Make for the woods! Twist and turn!"

“别他妈傻站着了！二波！躲避！躲避！”母鹅叫道，“动起来，朝我这儿跑！旋转跳跃，左左右右，前前后后！往林子里跑！注意迂回隐蔽！”

The cocker spaniel sprang for Wilbur's hind leg. Wilbur jumped and ran. Lurvy reached out and grabbed. Mrs. Zuckerman screamed at Lurvy. The goose cheered for Wilbur. Wilbur dodged between Lurvy's legs. Lurvy missed Wilbur and grabbed the spaniel instead. 

那只可卡犬朝魏二波的后腿扑去。二波贼机灵，又跑又跳。卢伟伸手向他抓去。朱克慢太太对着卢伟大喊；母鹅则为二波加油。魏二波呲溜一下钻到卢伟的裤裆下，他失手没有抓住二波，倒把可卡犬拦住了。

"Nicely done, nicely done!" cried the goose." Try it again, try it again!"

“干得漂亮！干得漂亮！”母鹅喝彩道，“再来一次！再来一次！”

"Run downhill!" suggested the cows.

“往山下跑！”母牛建议。

"Run toward me!" yelled the gander.

“朝我这儿跑！”公鹅大喊。

"Run uphill!" cried the sheep.

“跑上坡！”羊叫道。

"Turn and twist!" honked the goose.

“迂回！一定要注意迂回！”母鹅嘎嘎叫道。

"Jump and dance!" said the rooster.

“跳跃，蹦高点儿！”公鸡说。

"Look out for Lurvy!" called the cows.

“小心卢伟！”母牛提醒道。

"Look out for Zuckerman!" yelled the gander.

“小心朱克慢！”公鸭扯着嗓子喊。

"Watch out for the dog!" cried the sheep.

“小心那条狗！”绵羊提醒道。

"Listen to me, listen to me!" screamed the goose.

“听我说，听我说！”母鹅尖叫。

Poor Wilbur was dazed and frightened by this hullabaloo. He didn't like being the center of all this fuss. He tried to follow the instructions his friends were giving him, but he couldn't run downhill and uphill at the same time, and he couldn't turn and twist when he was jumping and dancing, and he was crying so hard he could barely see anything that was happening. After all, Wilbur was a very young pig-not much more than a baby, really. He wished Fern were there to take him in his arms and comfort him. 

可怜的魏二波被乱叫声弄得头昏脑涨，他害怕极了。他不想成为这些麻烦的焦点。他努力按照朋友们给出的建议去做，但是他总不能同时往山上又往山下跑，他不能一边蹦跳一边迂回前进，更何况他哭得那么厉害，模糊了视线，几乎看不到周围的一切。此时他多么希望阿芬在这里，抱着他，安慰他。

When he looked up and saw Mr. Zuckerman standing quite close to him, holding a pail of warm slops, he felt relieved. He lifted his nose and sniffed. The smell was delicious-warm milk, potato skins, wheat middlings, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, and a popover left from the Zuckermans' breakfast.

所以当他抬头看见朱克慢先生站在离自己不远的地方，手里提着一桶热乎乎的猪食，内心感到如释重负。他耸起鼻子，闻了闻，真香啊！热牛奶，土豆皮，小麦麸，玉米片，还有朱克慢一家早餐吃剩的酥饼。

"Come, pig!" said Mr. Zuckerman, tapping the pail. "Come pig!"Wilbur took a step toward the pail.

“来吧，猪猪！”朱克慢先生敲着桶说，“乖哦，小猪猪！”魏二波不由自主地朝前迈了一步。

"No-no-no!" said the goose. "It's the old pail trick, Wilbur. Don't fall for it, don't fall for it ! He's trying to lure you back into captivity-ivity. He's appealing to your stomach."

“不……不……不！”母鹅大叫，“这是一个老把戏，二波，不要上当！不要上当！他正在利用你的胃，引诱你过去！”

Wilbur didn't care. The food smelled appetizing. He took another step toward the pail.

魏二波满不在乎，食物闻起来非常可口，他又朝桶走了一步。

"Pig, pig!" said Mr. Zuckerman in a kind voice, and began walking slowly toward the barnyard, looking all about him innocently, as if he didn't know that a little white pig was following along behind him.

“小猪猪，小猪猪！”朱克慢用和蔼的声音，同时慢慢地向谷仓走去，装作若无其事的样子，仿佛不知道后面跟着一只小白猪。

"You'll be sorry-sorry-sorry," called the goose.

“你一定会后悔……后悔……后悔！”母鹅失望道。

Wilbur didn't care. He kept walking toward the pail of slops.

魏二波全不在意，继续朝那桶猪食走去。

"You'll miss your freedom," honked the goose. "An hour of freedom is worth a barrel of slops."

“你会失去自由！”母鹅叫道，“一小时的自由胜过一桶泔水！”

Wilbur didn't care.

二波什么都不在乎。

When Mr. Zuckerman reached the pigpen, he climbed over the fence and poured the slops into the trough. Then he pulled the loose board away from the fence, so that there was a wide hole for Wilbur to walk through.

祖克曼走到猪圈附近，爬过栅栏，把猪食倒进猪食槽。然后他把那块松动的木板拽下来，好让二波能够顺利通过。

"Reconsider, reconsider!" cried the goose.

“再想想！再想想！”母鹅叫道。

Wilbur paid no attention. He stepped through the fence into his yard. He walked to the trough and took a long drink of slops, sucking in the milk hungrily and chewing the popover. It was good to be home again.

魏二波觉得什么都不必考虑。他穿过栅栏，进入院子，走向食槽，狠狠地吸了一大口。喝着牛奶，嚼着酥饼。回家的感觉真好！

While Wilbur ate, Lurvy fetched a hammer and some 8-penny nails and nailed the board in place. Then he and Mr. Zuckerman leaned lazily on the fence and Mr. Zuckerman scratched Wilbur's back with a stick.

就在二波饱餐之际，卢伟取了把锤子和一些八分长的钉子，把那块板子钉了回去。然后，他和朱克慢懒洋洋地倚在栅栏旁。朱克慢用一根柴枝搔着魏二波的后背。

"He's quite a pig," said Lurvy.

“他真是一头猪。”卢伟说。

"Yes, he'll make a good pig," said Mr. Zuckerman.

“是的，他会成为一头好猪。”朱克慢说。

Wilbur heard the words of praise. He felt the warm milk inside his stomach. He felt the pleasant rubbing of the stick along his itchy back. He felt peaceful and happy and sleepy. This had been a tiring afternoon. It was still only about four o'clock but Wilbur was ready for bed.

魏二波听到了赞美的话；他感到胃里有热牛奶；他感到棍子沿着他发痒的后背愉快地摩擦着。这一切使他感到平静和幸福。真是一个疲惫不安的下午啊！不到四点钟，他就准备上床睡觉了。

"I'm really too young to go out into the world alone," he thought as he lay down.

“我还太年轻，现在出去闯荡江湖为时过早呐。”二波躺着想。
