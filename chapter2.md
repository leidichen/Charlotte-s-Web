# 02  Wilbur \| 魏二波

Fern loved Wilbur more than anything. She loved to stroke him, to feed him, to put him to bed.

魏二波成了阿芬的最爱。每天抚摸他，喂他，哄他睡觉。

Every morning, as soon as she got up, she warmed his milk, tied his bib on, and held the bottle for him.

每天清晨，她一起床就去热牛奶，给魏二波戴上围嘴，帮他拿着奶瓶。

Every afternoon, when the school bus stopped in front of her house, she jumped out and ran to the kitchen to fix another bottle for him. She fed him again at suppertime, and again just before going to bed.

每天中午，当校车停在家门口时，她立刻从车里跳出来，跑进厨房，准备好另一瓶牛奶，待到晚餐喂他；睡前，再喂一次。

Mrs. Arable gave him a feeding around noontime each day,when Fern was away in school. Wilbur loved his milk, and he was never happier than when Fern was warming up a bottle for him. He would stand and gaze up at her with adoring eyes.

阿芬的妈妈，负责每天中午喂奶，直到阿芬放学。魏二波非常喜欢喝牛奶。当阿芬为他热牛奶时，他会站着，用崇拜的目光凝望她。

For the first few days of his life, Wilbur was allowed to live in a box near the stove in the kitchen. Then when Mrs. Arable complained, he was moved to a bigger box in the woodshed.

魏二波刚出生的前几天，睡在靠近厨房炉子边的盒子里。阿拉巴太太抱怨这样不行，于是魏二波，安排到柴房，拥有一个更大的盒子。

At two weeks of age, he was moved outdoors. It was apple-blossom time, and the days were getting warmer. Mr. Arable fixed a small yard specially for Wilbur under an apple tree, and gave him a large wooden box full of straw, with a doorway cut in it so he could walk in and out as he pleased.

魏二波两周大时，他再次搬家，到了户外。这是一个苹果树花开的季节，天气渐暖。阿拉巴先生在苹果树下修了一个小院子，大木箱里面装满稻草，并为其装了一扇门。魏二波可以随心所欲的进出。

"Won't he be cold at night?" asked Fern.

“晚上他会感冒吗？”阿芬问。

"No," said her father. "Your watch and see what he does."

“不会啊，”她爸爸说：“到时你就明白了。”

Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard.

阿芬拿着牛奶，坐在院子里的苹果树下，若有所思。

Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw. Fern was enchanted. It relieved her mind to know that her baby would sleep covered up, and would stay warm.

魏二波跑过来喝奶。喝得一滴不剩，很快倦意上头。他哼哼唧唧，走回木箱，准备睡觉。阿芬偷眼观瞧，只见魏二波用鼻子拱稻草，眨眼功夫就挖出一个洞穴。他爬进去，稻草将其身体团团包裹，不见其踪。阿芬看得入迷，见二波睡得如此安稳，这下子她终于放心了。


Every morning after breakfast, Wilbur walked out to the road with Fern and waited with her till the bus came. She would wave good-bye to him, and he would stand and watch the bus until it vanished around a turn.

每天吃过早饭，阿芬带着魏二波去外面散步，顺便等校车。阿芬同魏二波挥手道别，二波站着，目送阿芬，直到校车消失在转弯口。

While Fern was in school, Wilbur was shut up inside his yard. But as soon as she got home in the afternoon, she would take him out and he would follow her around the place.

当阿芬在学校时，魏二波则关在自己的院子里。阿芬下午回到家，就把他放出来，带到外面，四处闲逛。

If she went into the house, Wilbur went, too.

倘若她回家，二波也跟着。

If she went upstairs, Wilbur would wait at the bottom step until she came down again.

倘若她上楼，二波就在楼梯口等着。

If she took her doll for a walk in the doll carriage, Wilbur followed along.

倘若她带着玩偶，推着玩具车出去散步，二波紧随其后。

Sometimes, on these journeys, Wilbur would get tired, and Fern would pick him up and put him in the carriage alongside the doll.

有时，二波走得很累，阿芬就把它抱起，放进玩具车，睡在玩偶旁边。


He liked this. And if he was very tired, he would close his eyes and go to sleep under the doll's blanket.

他喜欢这样！困意来袭，他闭上眼睛，睡在娃娃毯下。

He looked cute when his eyes were closed, because his lashes were so long. The doll would close her eyes, too, and Fern would wheel the carriage very slowly and smoothly so as not to wake her infants.

他睡着的样子真好看！因为二波的眼睫毛很长。于是，娃娃也闭上了眼睛。阿芬慢慢推着车，动作尽量平稳，以免惊扰到她的宝宝们睡觉。

One warm afternoon, Fern and Avery put on bathing suits and went down to the brook for a swim. Wilbur tag ged along at Fern's heels.

一个温暖的午后，阿芬和阿福穿上泳衣，去小溪游泳。魏二波紧紧其后，生怕掉队。

When she waded into the brook, Wilbur waded in with her. He found the water quite cold--too cold for his liking. So while the children swam and played and splashed water at each other, Wilbur amused himself in the mud along the edge of the brook, where it was warm and moist and delightfully sticky and oozy.

他们刚踏进小溪，二波发现水太凉了，不适合他。因此，当孩子们游泳，玩耍，相互泼水时，二波只能在小溪边的烂泥中自得其乐。泥水温暖而湿润，粘稠而柔软，令猪愉悦！


Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful.

从白天到黑夜，快乐而平静的生活，日复一日。

Wilbur was what farmers call a spring pig, which simply means that he was born in springtime. When he was five weeks old, Mr. Arable said he was now big enough to sell,and would have to be sold.

农民们称魏二波为“春之猪”，因为他出生在春天。当他五周大的时候，阿拉巴先生说，他的个头足够大，可以卖了，注意是必须！

Fern broke down and wept. But her father was firm about it.

阿芬当场崩溃，痛哭流涕。但是她的父亲不为所动，坚持要卖掉魏二波。

Wilbur's appetite had increased; he was beginning to eat scraps of food in addition to milk. Mr. Arable was not willing to provide for him any longer . He had already sold Wilbur's ten brothers and sisters.

魏二波的胃口不断增加；不再只喝牛奶，开始吃泔水。阿拉巴先生不愿意再这样养着它，何况魏二波的十个兄弟姐妹都已经卖了。

"He's got to go, Fern," he said.

“他必须离开，阿芬。”她父亲说。

"You have had your fun raising a baby pig, but Wilbur is not a baby any longer and he has got to be sold."

“当初你养他是因为他还是头小猪，如今他已经不再弱不禁风，他必须被卖掉。”

"Call up the Zuckermans," suggested Mrs. Arable to Fern.

阿拉巴太太出来打圆场，同阿芬建议：“不如打电话给朱可慢家。”

"Your Uncle Homer sometimes raises a pig. And if Wilbur goes there to live, you can walk down the road and visit him as often as you like."

“你的霍闷舅舅有时候会养一只猪，如果二波去他那儿，你可以随时去看他。”

"How much money should I ask for him?" Fern wanted to know.

阿芬想了想说：“那我该问他要多少钱？”

"Well," said her father, "he's a runt. Tell your Uncle Homer you've got a pig you'll sell for six dollars, and see what he says."

“这样才对嘛，”她爸爸说道：“二波是棒小伙儿！告诉你的霍闷舅舅，你有一头猪，只卖六美金，看他怎么说。”

It was soon arranged. Fern phoned and got her Aunt Edith,and her Aunt Edith hollered for Uncle Homer, and Uncle Homer came in from the barn and talked to Fern.

一切准备妥当，阿芬给她的迪迪阿姨打电话，迪迪阿姨去叫霍闷舅舅接电话。他从谷仓回来，和阿芬通话。

When he heard that the price was only six dollars, he said he would buy the pig.

当他听闻一只猪只要六美金，当场决定：这头猪我要了！

Next day Wilbur was taken from his home under the apple tree and went to live in a manure pile in the cellar of Zuchkerman's barn.

第二天，魏二波从苹果树下的家中被带走，随即安排住进朱克慢家的谷仓。
